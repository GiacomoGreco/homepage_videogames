  <h1 class="title">Story</h1>

  <h3 class="intro">
    Donkey Kong is running from the boss named bowser because Donkey Kong did a spite to bowser stealing an costly gem that is called diamond stone. Donkey stilled  the gem to the boss bowser because he wanted to do an crazy thing but he didn’t think about his consequences. 

    In the fist level until the fourth Kong is running from bowser and avoiding the barrels that he is throwing to him and trying to hide from him but was impossible o hide from him because there weren’t any places to hide
    
    Instead in the fifths Kong needs to fight bowser because he arrived in an impasse street that for escape there was only one a way but bowser it blocked the way so he needed to fight him.
