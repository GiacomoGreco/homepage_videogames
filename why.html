  <p>Hello everyone we are Giacomo, Valentino and Diletta. 
    We wanted to create an extra page for speak about us and
    why we created this game.</p> 
    
    <h2>WHY?</h2>

    <p> We created this game named Donkey Kong for our summative of computer science, 
      but the main porpouse of this game is that it remembers to me an videogame that I
     played since i was little that was name Donkey kong.
