            Donkey Kong is running away from Browser, the boss, because he stole from him an expensive gem, the diamond stone.
            The gorilla wanted to do something crazy, but he didnâ€™t think about the consequences.

            From the first level to the fourth, Donkey Kong is running away from the boss by avoiding the barrels he placed on his trail.

            Instead in the fifth one, Donkey Kong needs to avoid Browser, who comes willing to block the trail with his own mighty body.
            
            Your job consists in jumping all the obstacles... including Browser!
